## What is Dinokiki? 
Dinokiki is a website created in 2014 when I was starting my career as a web developer. It is considered an "useless" website, since its purpose is having fun!

It's a website of a green dinosaur, when you click over him, he will start saying "kiki" with a random voice. That's it. All of it glorious purpose!!!!!

## How is it made?
Dinokiki had different stacks since 2014. Initially, it was jQuery with a front-end only, then jQuery for the front-end and CodeIgniter for the back-end. And today, I use Vue.js for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end.

## Can I send a kiki?
You should! Access this [google form](#) to submit your kiki. Please read the rules.
I might take a long time to include it, as I update Dinokiki once a year.

## Why do you still have this website if you don't update it that often?
Well, it's my first website, and I love this project.
I hope I can always fit Dinokiki in my life, and include a new feature/improvement every year.

## Technical Stuff

### Commands
``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn serve

# build for production with minification
yarn build
```

## Can I contribute?
If you have an idea for improvement, please create an issue or pull request.

I'm not interested in big changes (e.g. changing stacks, or including new components), but a bugfix for an accessibility suggestion will be very welcome!

## The end
Thanks for reading this readme, I really like readme files, but I think most developers just ignore it.
Have a great day and don't forget to submit your kiki!!
